    <h1>Panjabian Cuisine</h1>
    <p>
        Punjab is one of the most prosperous states in India, and the food of Punjab attests to this in every morsel. Even though it is known as the breadbasket of India, we get so much more than just that in their cuisine. Down south, a lot of people think that most North Indians are Punjabi and you can't blame them given all the Punjabi influence in the culture up north! No matter what divides people, food has the power to unite us as Indians, especially the rich Punjabi food with its succulent taste and desi ghee. And with Pakistan being Punjab's neighbour, a lot of Pakistani flavours have also seeped into the cuisine of Punjab giving it even more exotic flavour.
